### Background-matching stimuli 
Stimuli = white noise x Gaussian filter <br>
Made of two parts: a background and a target. The location of the target is randomised across the background space. Once both parts are assembled, the resulting image is grayscaled (conversion to an intensity image). 

Fourier slope of backgrounds: -1; -2; -3 <br>
Fourier slope of targets: -1; -1.5; -2; -2.5; -3

Size of images: 650 x 650 <br>
Size of targets: 20 x 20 ; 40 x 40 ; 60 x 60

Shape of the target: circles or angular blobs or round blobs
